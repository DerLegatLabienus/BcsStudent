# Managing an Open Source Project

In this blog post, we will discuss how to effectively manage an open source project. We will start by referencing the [ci-checklist blogpost](link-to-ci-checklist-blogpost), and then we will explore some automation techniques to engage developers and keep track of their assigned issues.

## CI Checklist

The [ci-checklist blogpost](link-to-ci-checklist-blogpost) provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for your open source project. It covers topics such as:

- Setting up a CI server
- Configuring build scripts
- Running tests automatically
- Deploying your application

## Engaging Developers

Engaging developers in an open source project can be challenging. Here are some automation techniques that can help:

### Automated Welcome Messages

When a developer first contributes to your project, you can use a bot to send them a welcome message. This can include information about the project and how they can contribute.

```python
# Example of a bot sending a welcome message
def send_welcome_message(user):
    message = f"Welcome {user.name}! Thank you for your contribution. Here's how you can help..."
    user.send_message(message)
```
