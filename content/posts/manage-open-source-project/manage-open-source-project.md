In this blog post, I will discuss how to effectively manage an open source project. Some of the objective I already implemented in my projects, and some of them are principals that I think should be followed as an Open Source maintainer.

Unlike the [CI Checklist] post which is focusing on maintaining a project, this post is from the contributor perspective.

An early version of this post is the short talk I gave on the subject and is available on YouTube.



## CI Checklist

The [ci-checklist blogpost](link-to-ci-checklist-blogpost) provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for your open source project. It covers topics such as:

- Setting up a CI server
- Configuring build scripts
- Running tests automatically
- Deploying your application

## Engaging Developers

Engaging developers in an open source project can be challenging. Here are some automation techniques that can help:

### Automated Welcome Messages

When a developer first contributes to your project, you can use a bot to send them a welcome message. This can include information about the project and how they can contribute.

```python
# Example of a bot sending a welcome message
def send_welcome_message(user):
    message = f"Welcome {user.name}! Thank you for your contribution. Here's how you can help..."
    user.send_message(message)
```
